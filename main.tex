\section{Task 1}
We separately declared and defined the Taylor functions even though the program is very small, to see that we understood how to do it.

Neither of the two functions reassign their input variables \lstinline{N, x}, so to reduce the number of copied variables we set the types to \lstinline{const int&} and \lstinline{const double&} respectively.

As asked we verified that each error is bounded by the $N+1^{\rm{st}}$ term, for $N \in \{3,5,10\}$ and $x \in \{âˆ’1,1,2,3,5,10\}$. For all 18 choices of $(N,x)$ we printed whether the error was bounded by $N+1^{\rm{st}}$ term, both for $\sin$ and $\cos$. These results were counted, giving the following final output:

\lstinline{Bounded errors: 36}

\lstinline{Unbounded errors: 0}

\flushleft{For higher values of $N$ the limit in precision when calculating the error as well as the $N+1^{\rm{st}}$ term resulted in some errors being marked as unbounded.}

\section{Task 2}
For this task we declared and defined the functions in the main file as the program is so small. We separated the files properly in task 1 to show that we know how to do it.

The algorithms was implemented as
